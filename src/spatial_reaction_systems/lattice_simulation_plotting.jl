    lattice_plot(sol, sp, lrs::LatticeReactionSystem, filename::String; t = sol.tspan[2], kwargs...)

Creates a plot of a `LatticeReactionSystem` simulation. The plot is created at the time point
specified by `t` (defaults to the simulation's final time point).

Arguments (all lattices):
- `sol`: The simulation we wish to plot.
- `sp`: The species whose values we wish to plot. Can be provided either in its symbolic form or as a symbol.
- `lrs`: The `LatticeReactionSystem` which was simulated.
- `t = sol.t[end]`: The time point at which we wish to plot the solution

In addition, depending on the type of lattice used, the following optional arguments might be relevant.

Arguments (1d lattices):
- `markersize = 20`: The size of the markers marking each compartment's value.

Arguments (Graph & 2d lattices):
- `colormap = :BuGn_7`: The colour map with which we display the species amounts in the animation.
- `plot_min = nothing`: The minimum value for the colour scale (values less than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value (across the entire simulation, not just at the plotted time value).
- `plot_max = nothing`: The maximum value for the colour scale (values more than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value (across the entire simulation, not just at the plotted time value).

Arguments (Graph lattices):
- `node_size = 50`: The size of the compartments in the plot.
- `layout = Spring()`: The layout for the graph nodes in the plot. Can be provided as a vector, where the i'th element is a 2-valued tuple (determining the i'th compartment's y and x positions, respectively).

Notes: 
- For masked lattices, there are no value displayed for grid points which do not correspond to a compartments.
- The current plotting interface is a work in progress, and modifications are expected. if you have any feedback, please contact the package authors.
- Additional arguments can be passed to `lattice_plot`, which then will be passed to Makie's `lines` plotting command.

"""
    lattice_animation(sol, sp, lrs::LatticeReactionSystem, filename::String; kwargs...)

Creates an animation of a `LatticeReactionSystem` simulation. The animation is saved to a file, 
whose name is provided in the `filename` argument.

Arguments (all lattices):
- `sol`: The simulation we wish to animate.
- `sp`: The species which values we wish to animate. Can be provided either in its symbolic form or as a symbol.
- `lrs`: The `LatticeReactionSystem` which was simulated.
- `filename`: The name of the file to which we wish to save the animation.
- `nframes = 200`: The number of frames in the animation (these are evenly samples across the simulation).
- `framerate = 20`: The frame rate of the animation.
- `ttitle = true`: Whether to add a title showing the simulation's time throughout the animation.

In addition, depending on the type of lattice used, the following optional arguments might be relevant.

Arguments (1d lattices):
- `markersize = 20`: The size of the markers marking each compartment's value.
- `plot_min = nothing`: The y-scale's minimum. If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value.
- `plot_max = nothing`: The y-scale's maximum. If `nothing`, use the simulation's maximum value.

Arguments (Graph & 2d lattices):
- `colormap = :BuGn_7`: The colour map with which we display the species amounts in the animation.
- `plot_min = nothing`: The minimum value for the colour scale (values less than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value.
- `plot_max = nothing`: The maximum value for the colour scale (values more than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value.

- `layout = Spring()`: The layout for the graph nodes in the plot. Can be provided as a vector, where the i'th element is a 2-valued tuple (determining the i'th compartment's y and x positions, respectively).

Notes: 
- For masked lattices, there are no value displayed for grid points which do not correspond to a compartments.
- The current animation interface if a work in progress, and modifications are expected. if you have any feedback, please contact the package authors.
- Additional arguments can be passed to `lattice_animation`, which then will be passed to Makie's `heatmap` plotting command.

"""
    lattice_kymograph(sol, sp, lrs::LatticeReactionSystem, kwargs...)

Creates a kymograph of a `LatticeReactionSystem` simulation based on a Cartesian or masked lattice. 
The plot shows the compartments on the y-axis, and the time development of the system's state along
the x-axis. Species amounts are shown as a heatmap.

Arguments (all lattices):
- `sol`: The simulation we wish to plot.
- `sp`: The species whose values we wish to plot. Can be provided either in its symbolic form or as a symbol.
- `lrs`: The `LatticeReactionSystem` which was simulated.
- `colormap = :BuGn_7`: The colour map with which we display the species amounts in the kymograph.
- `nframes = 200`: The number of time samples which the time series is sampled with.
- `plot_min = nothing`: The minimum value for the colour scale (values less than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value.
- `plot_max = nothing`: The maximum value for the colour scale (values more than this will be set at this value when the colour scale is computed). If `nothing`, use the simulation's minimum value.

Notes: 
- For masked lattices, there are no value displayed for grid points which do not correspond to a compartments.

### Utility Functions ###
# Some of this is used by both extension

# Handles masked lattices by converting sparse arrays to dense arrays where missing values are
# replaced by `NaN` (which Makie can handle well in plotting). The `deepcopy` bit is due to a weird
# bug that I really cannot figure out. The conversion to Float64 is for jump simulations, where
# `NaN`s cannot be presented in Int64 vectors.
