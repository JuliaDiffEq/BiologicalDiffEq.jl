# Using Catalyst
In this tutorial we'll provide an introduction to using Catalyst to specify
chemical reaction networks, and then to solve ODE, jump, and SDE models generated
from them. Let's start by using the Catalyst [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro
to specify a simply chemical reaction network: the well-known repressilator.

We first import the basic packages we'll need:

```julia
# If not already installed, first hit "]" within a Julia REPL. Then type:
# add Catalyst DifferentialEquations Plots Latexify

using Catalyst, DifferentialEquations, Plots, Latexify
```

We now construct the reaction network. The basic types of arrows and predefined
rate laws one can use are discussed in detail within the next tutorial, [The
Reaction DSL](@ref). Here, we use a mix of first order, zero order, and repressive
Hill function rate laws. Note, $\varnothing$ corresponds to the empty state, and
is used for zeroth order production and first order degradation reactions:

```julia
repressilator = @reaction_network begin
    hillr(P₃,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₁
    hillr(P₁,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₂
    hillr(P₂,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₃
    (δ,γ), m₁ ↔ ∅
    (δ,γ), m₂ ↔ ∅
    (δ,γ), m₃ ↔ ∅
    β, m₁ --> m₁ + P₁
    β, m₂ --> m₂ + P₂
    β, m₃ --> m₃ + P₃
    μ, P₁ --> ∅
    μ, P₂ --> ∅
    μ, P₃ --> ∅
end α K n δ γ β μ;
```
[`@reaction_network`](@ref) returns a [`ReactionSystem`](@ref), which can be
converted to a variety of other mathematical models represented as
`ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`s.

We can use Latexify to look at the corresponding reactions and understand the
generated rates expressions for each reaction

```julia; results="hidden";
latexify(repressilator)
```
```math
\begin{align*}
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ \varnothing &->[\frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_3}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}}] m_{1}}\\
\ce{ \varnothing &->[\frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_1}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}}] m_{2}}\\
\ce{ \varnothing &->[\frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_2}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}}] m_{3}}\\
\ce{ m_{1} &<=>[\delta][\gamma] \varnothing}\\
\ce{ m_{2} &<=>[\delta][\gamma] \varnothing}\\
\ce{ m_{3} &<=>[\delta][\gamma] \varnothing}\\
\ce{ m_{1} &->[\beta] m_{1} + P_{1}}\\
\ce{ m_{2} &->[\beta] m_{2} + P_{2}}\\
\ce{ m_{3} &->[\beta] m_{3} + P_{3}}\\
\ce{ P_{1} &->[\mu] \varnothing}\\
\ce{ P_{2} &->[\mu] \varnothing}\\
\ce{ P_{3} &->[\mu] \varnothing}
\end{align*}
```

Assuming [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is installed and commandline
accessible, within a Jupyter notebook we can also graph the reaction network by
```julia
g = Graph(repressilator)
```
giving

![Repressilator solution](../assets/repressilator.svg)

The network graph shows a variety of information, representing each species as a
blue node, and each reaction as an orange dot. Black arrows from species to
reactions indicate reactants, and are labelled with their input stoichiometry.
Similarly, black arrows from reactions to species indicate products, and are
labelled with their output stoichiometry. In contrast, red arrows from a species
to reactions indicate the species is used within the reactions' rate
expressions. For the repressilator, the reactions
```julia
hillr(P₃,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₁
hillr(P₁,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₂
hillr(P₂,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₃
```
have rates that depend on the proteins, and hence lead to red arrows from each
`Pᵢ`.

Note, from the REPL or scripts one can always use [`savegraph`](@ref) to save
the graph (assuming `Graphviz` is installed).

## Mass Action ODE Models
Let's now use our `ReactionSystem` to generate and solve a corresponding mass
action ODE model. We first convert the system to a `ModelingToolkit.ODESystem`
by
```julia
odesys = convert(ODESystem, repressilator)
```
We can once again use Latexify to look at the corresponding ODE model
```julia; results="hidden";
latexify(odesys)
```
```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dm_1(t)}{dt} =& \frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_3}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}} - \delta \mathrm{m_1}\left( t \right) + \gamma \\
\frac{dm_2(t)}{dt} =& \frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_1}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}} - \delta \mathrm{m_2}\left( t \right) + \gamma \\
\frac{dm_3(t)}{dt} =& \frac{\alpha K^{n}}{K^{n} + \left( \mathrm{P_2}\left( t \right) \right)^{n}} - \delta \mathrm{m_3}\left( t \right) + \gamma \\
\frac{dP_1(t)}{dt} =& \beta \mathrm{m_1}\left( t \right) - \mu \mathrm{P_1}\left( t \right) \\
\frac{dP_2(t)}{dt} =& \beta \mathrm{m_2}\left( t \right) - \mu \mathrm{P_2}\left( t \right) \\
\frac{dP_3(t)}{dt} =& \beta \mathrm{m_3}\left( t \right) - \mu \mathrm{P_3}\left( t \right)
\end{aligned}
```
(Note, there is currently a Latexify bug that causes different fonts to be used
for the species symbols on each side of the equations.)

Before we can solve the ODEs, we need to specify the values of the parameters in
the model, the initial condition, and the time interval to solve the model on.
To do this it helps to know the orderings of the parameters and the species.
Parameters are ordered in the same order they appear after the `end` statement
in the [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro. Species are ordered in the order they
first appear within the [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro. We can see these
orderings using the `speciesmap` and `paramsmap` functions:

```julia
speciesmap(repressilator)
```
```julia
Dict{Term{Real},Int64} with 6 entries:
  P₃(t) => 6
  m₃(t) => 3
  P₂(t) => 5
  P₁(t) => 4
  m₁(t) => 1
  m₂(t) => 2
```

```julia
paramsmap(repressilator)
```
```julia
Dict{Sym{ModelingToolkit.Parameter{Real}},Int64} with 7 entries:
  μ => 7
  β => 6
  α => 1
  δ => 4
  K => 2
  n => 3
  γ => 5

```
which are consistent with the API functions:
```julia
species(repressilator)
```
```julia
6-element Array{Term{Real},1}:
 m₁(t)
 m₂(t)
 m₃(t)
 P₁(t)
 P₂(t)
 P₃(t)
```
```julia
params(repressilator)
```
```julia
7-element Array{Sym{ModelingToolkit.Parameter{Real}},1}:
 α
 K
 n
 δ
 γ
 β
 μ
```
Knowing these orderings, we can create parameter and initial condition vectors,
and then set up the `ODEProblem` we want to solve:

```julia
# parameters [α,K,n,δ,γ,β,μ]
p = (.5, 40, 2, log(2)/120, 5e-3, 20*log(2)/120, log(2)/60)

# initial condition [m₁,m₂,m₃,P₁,P₂,P₃]
u₀ = [0.,0.,0.,20.,0.,0.]

# time interval to solve on
tspan = (0., 10000.)

# create the ODEProblem we want to solve
oprob = ODEProblem(repressilator, u₀, tspan, p)
```

Note, by passing `repressilator` directly to the `ODEProblem` ModelingToolkit
has to (internally) call `convert(ODESystem, repressilator)` again. We could
instead pass `odesys` directly, provided we construct mappings from each species
to their initial value, and each parameter to their value like:
```julia
u₀map  = Pair.(species(repressilator), u₀)
pmap   = Pair.(params(repressilator), p)
oprob2 = ODEProblem(osys, u₀map, tspan, pmap)
```
`oprob` and `oprob2` are functionally equivalent, each representing the same
underlying problem.

At this point we are all set to solve the ODEs. We can now use any ODE solver
from within the
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/)
package. We'll use the recommended default explicit solver, `Tsit5()`, and then
plot the solutions:

```julia
sol = solve(oprob, Tsit5(), saveat=10.)
plot(sol)
```
![Repressilator ODE Solutions](../assets/repressilator_odes.svg)

We see the well-known oscillatory behavior of the repressilator! For more on the
choices of ODE solvers, see the [DifferentialEquations.jl
documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/).

## Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSAs) for Stochastic Chemical Kinetics
Let's now look at a stochastic chemical kinetics model of the repressilator,
modeling it with jump processes. Here, we will construct a
[DiffEqJump](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqJump.jl) `JumpProblem` that uses
Gillespie's `Direct` method, and then solve it to generate one realization of
the jump process:

```julia
# redefine the initial condition to be integer valued
u₀ = [0,0,0,20,0,0]

# next we create a discrete problem to encode that our species are integer valued:
dprob = DiscreteProblem(repressilator, u₀, tspan, p)

# now, we create a JumpProblem, and specify Gillespie's Direct Method as the solver:
jprob = JumpProblem(repressilator, dprob, Direct(), save_positions=(false,false))

# now, let's solve and plot the jump process:
sol = solve(jprob, SSAStepper(), saveat=10.)
plot(sol)
```
![Repressilator SSA Solutions](../assets/repressilator_jumps.svg)

We see that oscillations remain, but become much noisier. Note, in constructing
the `JumpProblem` we could have used any of the SSAs that are part of DiffEqJump
instead of the `Direct` method, see the list of SSAs (i.e., constant rate jump
aggregators) in the
[documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/types/jump_types/#Constant-Rate-Jump-Aggregators-1).

## Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE) Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Models
At an intermediate physical scale between macroscopic ODE models and microscopic
stochastic chemical kinetics models lies the CLE, given by a system of SDEs that
add to each ODE above a noise term. As the repressilator has species that get
very close to zero in size, it is not a good candidate to model with the CLE
(where solutions can then go negative and become unphysical). Let's create a
simpler reaction network for a birth-death process that will stay non-negative:

```julia
bdp = @reaction_network begin
  c₁, X --> 2X
  c₂, X --> 0
  c₃, 0 --> X
end c₁ c₂ c₃
p = (1.0,2.0,50.)
u₀ = [5.]
tspan = (0.,4.)
```

The corresponding Chemical Langevin Equation SDE is then

```math
dX(t) = \left( c_1 X\left( t \right) - c_2 X\left( t \right) + c_3 \right) dt + \sqrt{c_1 X(t)} dW_1(t) - \sqrt{c_2 X(t)} dW_2(t) + \sqrt{c_3} dW_3(t)
```

where each $W_i(t)$ denotes an independent Brownian Motion. We can solve the CLE
model by creating an `SDEProblem` and solving it similarly to what we did for ODEs
above:

```julia
# SDEProblem for CLE
sprob = SDEProblem(bdp, u₀, tspan, p)

# solve and plot, tstops is used to specify enough points
# that the plot looks well-resolved
sol = solve(sprob, LambaEM(), tstops=range(0., step=4e-3, length=1001))
plot(sol)
```
![CLE Solution](../assets/birthdeath_cle.svg)

We again have complete freedom to select any of the
StochasticDiffEq.jl SDE solvers, see the
[documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/sde_solve/).

## Notes
1. For each of the preceding models we converted the `ReactionSystem` to, i.e.,
   ODEs, jumps, or SDEs, we had two paths for conversion:

    a. Convert to the corresponding ModelingToolkit system and then use it in
       creating the corresponding problem.

    b. Directly create the desired problem type from the `ReactionSystem`.

   The latter is more convenient, however, the former will be more efficient if
   one needs to repeatedly create the associated `Problem`.
2. ModelingToolkit offers many options for optimizing the generated ODEs and
   SDEs, including options to build functions for evaluating Jacobians and/or
   multithreaded versions of derivative evaluation functions. See the options
   for
   [`ODEProblem`s](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/systems/ODESystem/#DiffEqBase.ODEProblem)
   and
   [`SDEProblem`s](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/systems/SDESystem/#DiffEqBase.SDEProblem).
