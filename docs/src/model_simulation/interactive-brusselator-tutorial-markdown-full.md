# Interactive Visualization of the Brusselator Model

In this tutorial, we'll create an interactive visualization of the Brusselator model using Catalyst.jl for model definition, OrdinaryDiffEq.jl for solving the ODE system, and GLMakie.jl for interactive plotting. We'll build this visualization step by step, explaining each part along the way.

## Introduction

The Brusselator is a theoretical model for a type of autocatalytic reaction. It's a classic example of a system that can exhibit oscillatory behavior and is often used to study dynamical systems.

[Here you would embed a short video demonstrating the final interactive visualization]

```julia
# This code block would contain instructions for embedding the video
# For example:
# ```@raw html
# <video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay loop>
# <source src="path_to_your_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
# </video>
# ```
```

## Step 1: Setting up the Environment

First, let's import the necessary packages and define our Brusselator model:

```julia
using Catalyst
using OrdinaryDiffEq
using GLMakie

# Define the Brusselator model
brusselator = @reaction_network begin
    A, ∅ → X
    1, 2X + Y → 3X
    B, X → Y
    1, X → ∅
end

# Initial parameter values and conditions
p = [:A => 1.0, :B => 3.0]
u0 = [:X => 1.0, :Y => 1.0]
tspan = (0.0, 50.0)

oprob = ODEProblem(brusselator, u0, tspan, p)
```

This code sets up our Brusselator model using Catalyst.jl's `@reaction_network` macro. We also define initial parameters, initial conditions, and create an `ODEProblem`.

## Step 2: Creating a Basic Plot

Let's start by creating a basic plot of our Brusselator model:

```julia
# Create the main figure
fig = Figure(size = (800, 600), fontsize = 18)

# Create an axis for the plot
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], 
    title = "Brusselator Model", 
    xlabel = "Time", 
    ylabel = "Concentration")

# Solve the ODE
sol = solve(oprob, Tsit5())

# Plot the solution
lines!(ax, sol.t, sol[:X], label = "X", color = :blue)
lines!(ax, sol.t, sol[:Y], label = "Y", color = :red)

# Add a legend
axislegend(ax, position = :rt)

# Display the figure
display(fig)
```

This will produce a basic time series plot of the Brusselator model:

## Step 3: Adding Interactivity with Observables

Now, let's add interactivity to our plot. We'll do this step-by-step, explaining each addition as we go.

### 3.1 Setting up the layout

First, we'll set up a layout that includes space for our plot and for sliders:

```julia
# Create the main figure
fig = Figure(size = (800, 600), fontsize = 18)

# Create layout for plot and sliders
plot_layout = fig[1, 1] = GridLayout()
slider_layout = fig[2, 1] = GridLayout()

# Create an axis for the plot
ax = Axis(plot_layout[1, 1], 
    title = "Brusselator Model", 
    xlabel = "Time", 
    ylabel = "Concentration")
```

This code creates a figure with two main areas: one for our plot and one for our soon-to-be-added sliders.

### 3.2 Creating Observables

Next, we'll create Observables for our parameters and initial conditions. Observables are a key concept in reactive programming and are central to how Makie.jl creates interactive visualizations.

```julia
# Create observables for parameters and initial conditions
A = Observable(1.0)
B = Observable(3.0)
X0 = Observable(1.0)
Y0 = Observable(1.0)
```

An Observable is a container for a value that can change over time. When the value changes, any dependent computations are automatically updated.

### 3.3 Adding Sliders

Now, let's add sliders that will control our Observables:

```julia
# Create sliders
slider_A = Slider(slider_layout[1, 1], range = 0.1:0.1:5.0, startvalue = 1.0)
slider_B = Slider(slider_layout[2, 1], range = 0.1:0.1:5.0, startvalue = 3.0)
slider_X0 = Slider(slider_layout[3, 1], range = 0.1:0.1:5.0, startvalue = 1.0)
slider_Y0 = Slider(slider_layout[4, 1], range = 0.1:0.1:5.0, startvalue = 1.0)

# Add labels for sliders
Label(slider_layout[1, 1, Left()], "A")
Label(slider_layout[2, 1, Left()], "B")
Label(slider_layout[3, 1, Left()], "X₀")
Label(slider_layout[4, 1, Left()], "Y₀")
```

These sliders will allow us to interactively change the values of our parameters and initial conditions.

### 3.4 Connecting Sliders to Observables

To make our sliders actually control the Observables, we need to connect them:

```julia
# Connect sliders to observables
connect!(A, slider_A.value)
connect!(B, slider_B.value)
connect!(X0, slider_X0.value)
connect!(Y0, slider_Y0.value)
```

Now, when a slider is moved, it will update its corresponding Observable.

### 3.5 Creating a Reactive Solution

We want our ODE solution to update whenever our parameters or initial conditions change. We can do this by creating a function that solves the ODE and an Observable that depends on our parameter Observables:

```julia
# Function to solve the ODE
function solve_brusselator(A, B, X0, Y0)
    p = [:A => A, :B => B]
    u0 = [:X => X0, :Y => Y0]
    prob = remake(oprob, p=p, u0=u0)
    solve(prob, Tsit5())
end

# Create an observable for the solution
solution = @lift(solve_brusselator($A, $B, $X0, $Y0))
```

The `@lift` macro creates a new Observable that depends on other Observables. Whenever A, B, X0, or Y0 change, `solution` will automatically update.

### 3.6 Plotting the Reactive Solution

Finally, we can plot our reactive solution:

```julia
# Plot the solution
lines!(ax, lift(sol -> sol.t, solution), lift(sol -> sol[:X], solution), label = "X", color = :blue)
lines!(ax, lift(sol -> sol.t, solution), lift(sol -> sol[:Y], solution), label = "Y", color = :red)

# Add a legend
axislegend(ax, position = :rt)

# Display the figure
display(fig)
```

Here, we use `lift` again to create Observables for our plot data that depend on the `solution` Observable. This means our plot will automatically update whenever the solution changes.

The resulting figure should look like this:

### Understanding the Reactivity

When a slider is moved, it triggers a chain reaction:
1. The slider updates its corresponding Observable (A, B, X0, or Y0).
2. This causes the `solution` Observable to recompute.
3. The lifted Observables for plotting update because `solution` changed.
4. The plot automatically updates to reflect these changes.

This reactive approach allows for smooth, efficient updates to our visualization as parameters change. You can now interact with the sliders and see the Brusselator model's behavior change in real-time!

## Step 4: Adding a Phase Plot

Let's enhance our visualization by adding a phase plot:

```julia
# Create the main figure
fig = Figure(size = (1200, 800), fontsize = 18)

# Create main layout: plots on top, sliders at bottom
plot_grid = fig[1, 1] = GridLayout()
slider_grid = fig[2, 1] = GridLayout()

# Create sub-grids for plots
time_plot = plot_grid[1, 1] = GridLayout()
phase_plot = plot_grid[1, 2] = GridLayout()

# Create axes for the time series plot and phase plot
ax_time = Axis(time_plot[1, 1], 
    title = "Brusselator Model - Time Series", 
    xlabel = "Time", 
    ylabel = "Concentration")

ax_phase = Axis(phase_plot[1, 1], 
    title = "Brusselator Model - Phase Plot", 
    xlabel = "X", 
    ylabel = "Y")

# ... [previous code for sliders and observables] ...

# Plot the time series
lines!(ax_time, lift(sol -> sol.t, solution), lift(sol -> sol[:X], solution), label = "X", color = :blue)
lines!(ax_time, lift(sol -> sol.t, solution), lift(sol -> sol[:Y], solution), label = "Y", color = :red)

# Plot the phase plot
phase_plot_obj = lines!(ax_phase, lift(sol -> sol[:X], solution), lift(sol -> sol[:Y], solution), 
                        color = lift(sol -> sol.t, solution), colormap = :viridis)

# Add a colorbar for the phase plot
Colorbar(phase_plot[1, 2], phase_plot_obj, label = "Time")

# Add legends
axislegend(ax_time, position = :rt)

# Display the figure
display(fig)
```

This will create a visualization with both time series and phase plots:

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've created an interactive visualization of the Brusselator model using Catalyst.jl, OrdinaryDiffEq.jl, and GLMakie.jl. We've learned how to:

1. Define a reaction network using Catalyst.jl
2. Solve the resulting ODE system using OrdinaryDiffEq.jl
3. Create interactive plots with GLMakie.jl
4. Use Observables to create reactive, interactive visualizations
5. Add multiple plot types to enhance understanding of system dynamics

This interactive visualization allows for easy exploration of the Brusselator model's behavior under different conditions, making it a powerful tool for understanding complex dynamical systems.

For further exploration, you could:
- Add more parameters to interact with
- Implement different ODE solvers and compare their performance
- Add additional plot types or analyses
- Extend this approach to other reaction networks

Remember, the power of this approach lies in its interactivity. Experiment with different parameter values and initial conditions to gain insights into the Brusselator's behavior!
