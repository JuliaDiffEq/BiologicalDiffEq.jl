# [Introduction to Catalyst](@id introduction_to_catalyst)
In this tutorial we provide an introduction to using Catalyst to specify
chemical reaction networks, and then to solve ODE, jump, and SDE models
generated from them. At the end we show what mathematical rate laws and
transition rate functions (i.e. intensities or propensities) are generated by
Catalyst for ODE, SDE and jump process models.

Let's start by using the Catalyst [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro
to specify a simple chemical reaction network: the well-known repressilator.

We first import the basic packages we'll need:

```@example tut1
# If not already installed, first hit "]" within a Julia REPL. Then type:
# add Catalyst DifferentialEquations Plots Latexify

using Catalyst, DifferentialEquations, Plots, Latexify
```

We now construct the reaction network. The basic types of arrows and predefined
rate laws one can use are discussed in detail within the tutorial, [The Reaction
DSL](@ref dsl_description). Here, we use a mix of first order, zero order, and repressive Hill
function rate laws. Note, $\varnothing$ corresponds to the empty state, and is
used for zeroth order production and first order degradation reactions:
```@example tut1
repressilator = @reaction_network Repressilator begin
    hillr(P₃,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₁
    hillr(P₁,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₂
    hillr(P₂,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₃
    (δ,γ), m₁ <--> ∅
    (δ,γ), m₂ <--> ∅
    (δ,γ), m₃ <--> ∅
    β, m₁ --> m₁ + P₁
    β, m₂ --> m₂ + P₂
    β, m₃ --> m₃ + P₃
    μ, P₁ --> ∅
    μ, P₂ --> ∅
    μ, P₃ --> ∅
end
show(stdout, MIME"text/plain"(), repressilator) # hide
```
showing that we've created a new network model named `Repressilator` with the
listed chemical species and states. [`@reaction_network`](@ref) returns a
[`ReactionSystem`](@ref), which we saved in the `repressilator` variable. It can
be converted to a variety of other mathematical models represented as
`ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`s, or analyzed in various ways using the
[Catalyst.jl API](@ref). For example, to see the chemical species, parameters,
and reactions we can use
```@example tut1
species(repressilator)
```
```@example tut1
parameters(repressilator)
```
and
```@example tut1
reactions(repressilator)
```
We can also use Latexify to see the corresponding reactions in Latex, which shows what
the `hillr` terms mathematically correspond to
```julia
latexify(repressilator)
```
```@example tut1
repressilator #hide
```
Assuming [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is installed and command line
accessible, within a Jupyter notebook we can also graph the reaction network by
```julia
g = Graph(repressilator)
```
giving

![Repressilator solution](../assets/repressilator.svg)

The network graph shows a variety of information, representing each species as a
blue node, and each reaction as an orange dot. Black arrows from species to
reactions indicate reactants, and are labelled with their input stoichiometry.
Similarly, black arrows from reactions to species indicate products, and are
labelled with their output stoichiometry. In contrast, red arrows from a species
to reactions indicate the species is used within the reactions' rate
expressions. For the repressilator, the reactions
```julia
hillr(P₃,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₁
hillr(P₁,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₂
hillr(P₂,α,K,n), ∅ --> m₃
```
have rates that depend on the proteins, and hence lead to red arrows from each
`Pᵢ`.

Note, from the REPL or scripts one can always use [`savegraph`](@ref) to save
the graph (assuming `Graphviz` is installed).

## Mass action ODE models
Let's now use our `ReactionSystem` to generate and solve a corresponding mass
action ODE model. We first convert the system to a `ModelingToolkit.ODESystem`
by
```@example tut1
odesys = convert(ODESystem, repressilator)
```
(Here Latexify is used automatically to display `odesys` in Latex within Markdown
documents or notebook environments like Pluto.jl.)

Before we can solve the ODEs, we need to specify the values of the parameters in
the model, the initial condition, and the time interval to solve the model on.
To do this we need to build mappings from the symbolic parameters and the
species to the corresponding numerical values for parameters and initial
conditions. We can build such mappings in several ways. One is to use Julia
`Symbols` to specify the values like
```@example tut1
pmap  = (:α => .5, :K => 40, :n => 2, :δ => log(2)/120,
         :γ => 5e-3, :β => log(2)/6, :μ => log(2)/60)
u₀map = [:m₁ => 0., :m₂ => 0., :m₃ => 0., :P₁ => 20., :P₂ => 0., :P₃ => 0.]
nothing   # hide
```
Alternatively, we can use ModelingToolkit-based symbolic species variables to
specify these mappings like
```@example tut1
@parameters  α K n δ γ β μ
@variables t
@species m₁(t) m₂(t) m₃(t) P₁(t) P₂(t) P₃(t)
psymmap  = (α => .5, K => 40, n => 2, δ => log(2)/120,
         γ => 5e-3, β => 20*log(2)/120, μ => log(2)/60)
u₀symmap = [m₁ => 0., m₂ => 0., m₃ => 0., P₁ => 20., P₂ => 0., P₃ => 0.]
nothing   # hide
```
Knowing these mappings we can set up the `ODEProblem` we want to solve:

```@example tut1
# time interval to solve on
tspan = (0., 10000.)

# create the ODEProblem we want to solve
oprob = ODEProblem(repressilator, u₀map, tspan, pmap)
nothing   # hide
```
By passing `repressilator` directly to the `ODEProblem`, Catalyst has to
(internally) call `convert(ODESystem, repressilator)` again to generate the
symbolic ODEs. We could instead pass `odesys` directly like
```@example tut1
oprob2 = ODEProblem(odesys, u₀symmap, tspan, psymmap)
nothing   # hide
```
`oprob` and `oprob2` are functionally equivalent, each representing the same
underlying problem.

!!! note
    When passing `odesys` to `ODEProblem` we needed to use the symbolic
    variable-based parameter mappings, `u₀symmap` and `psymmap`, while when
    directly passing `repressilator` we could use either those or the
    `Symbol`-based mappings, `u₀map` and `pmap`. `Symbol`-based mappings can
    always be converted to `symbolic` mappings using [`symmap_to_varmap`](@ref),
    see the [Basic Syntax](@ref basic_examples) section for more details.

At this point we are all set to solve the ODEs. We can now use any ODE solver
from within the
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/)
package. We'll use the recommended default explicit solver, `Tsit5()`, and then
plot the solutions:

```@example tut1
sol = solve(oprob, Tsit5(), saveat=10.)
plot(sol)
```
We see the well-known oscillatory behavior of the repressilator! For more on the
choices of ODE solvers, see the [DifferentialEquations.jl
documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/).

## Stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) for stochastic chemical kinetics
Let's now look at a stochastic chemical kinetics model of the repressilator,
modeling it with jump processes. Here, we will construct a
[JumpProcesses](https://docs.sciml.ai/JumpProcesses/stable/) `JumpProblem` that uses
Gillespie's `Direct` method, and then solve it to generate one realization of
the jump process:

```@example tut1
# redefine the initial condition to be integer valued
u₀map = [:m₁ => 0, :m₂ => 0, :m₃ => 0, :P₁ => 20, :P₂ => 0, :P₃ => 0]

# next we create a discrete problem to encode that our species are integer-valued:
dprob = DiscreteProblem(repressilator, u₀map, tspan, pmap)

# now, we create a JumpProblem, and specify Gillespie's Direct Method as the solver:
jprob = JumpProblem(repressilator, dprob, Direct(), save_positions=(false,false))

# now, let's solve and plot the jump process:
sol = solve(jprob, SSAStepper(), saveat=10.)
plot(sol)
```

We see that oscillations remain, but become much noisier. Note, in constructing
the `JumpProblem` we could have used any of the SSAs that are part of JumpProcesses
instead of the `Direct` method, see the list of SSAs (i.e., constant rate jump
aggregators) in the
[documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/JumpProcesses/stable/jump_types/#Jump-Aggregators-for-Exact-Simulation).

Common questions that arise in using the JumpProcesses SSAs (i.e. Gillespie methods)
are collated in the [JumpProcesses FAQ](https://docs.sciml.ai/JumpProcesses/stable/faq/).

## Chemical Langevin equation (CLE) stochastic differential equation (SDE) models
At an intermediate physical scale between macroscopic ODE models and microscopic
stochastic chemical kinetics models lies the CLE, given by a system of SDEs that
add to each ODE above a noise term. As the repressilator has species that get
very close to zero in size, it is not a good candidate to model with the CLE
(where solutions can then go negative and become unphysical). Let's create a
simpler reaction network for a birth-death process that will stay non-negative:

```@example tut1
bdp = @reaction_network begin
  c₁, X --> 2X
  c₂, X --> 0
  c₃, 0 --> X
end
p = (:c₁ => 1.0, :c₂ => 2.0, :c₃ => 50.)
u₀ = [:X => 5.]
tspan = (0.,4.)
nothing   # hide
```

The corresponding Chemical Langevin Equation SDE is then

```math
dX(t) = \left( c_1 X\left( t \right) - c_2 X\left( t \right) + c_3 \right) dt + \sqrt{c_1 X(t)} dW_1(t) - \sqrt{c_2 X(t)} dW_2(t) + \sqrt{c_3} dW_3(t)
```

where each $W_i(t)$ denotes an independent Brownian Motion. We can solve the CLE
model by creating an `SDEProblem` and solving it similarly to what we did for ODEs
above:

```@example tut1
# SDEProblem for CLE
sprob = SDEProblem(bdp, u₀, tspan, p)

# solve and plot, tstops is used to specify enough points
# that the plot looks well-resolved
sol = solve(sprob, LambaEM(), tstops = range(0., step = 4e-3, length = 1001))
plot(sol)
```

We again have complete freedom to select any of the
StochasticDiffEq.jl SDE solvers, see the
[documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/modules/DiffEqDocs/solvers/sde_solve/).

## Specifying a complete model via the DSL
In the previous examples we specified initial conditions and parameter values
via mappings that were constructed after building our [`ReactionSystem`](@ref).
Catalyst also supports specifying default values for these during
`ReactionSystem` construction. For example, for the last SDE example we
could have also built and simulated the complete model using the DSL like
```@example tut1
bdp2 = @reaction_network begin
    @parameters c₁ = 1.0 c₂ = 2.0 c₃ = 50.0
    @species X(t) = 5.0
    c₁, X --> 2X
    c₂, X --> 0
    c₃, 0 --> X
end
tspan = (0., 4.)
sprob2 = SDEProblem(bdp2, [], tspan)
```
Let's now simulate both models, starting from the same random number generator
seed, and check we get the same solutions
```@example tut1
using Random
Random.seed!(1)
sol = solve(sprob, LambaEM(), tstops = range(0., step = 4e-3, length = 1001))
p1 = plot(sol)
Random.seed!(1)
sol2 = solve(sprob2, LambaEM(), tstops = range(0., step = 4e-3, length = 1001))
p2 = plot(sol2)
plot(p1, p2, layout = (2,1))
```

For details on what information can be specified via the DSL see the [The
Reaction DSL](@ref dsl_description) tutorial.

## Reaction rate laws used in simulations
In generating mathematical models from a [`ReactionSystem`](@ref), reaction
rates are treated as *microscopic* rates. That is, for a general mass action
reaction of the form $n_1 S_1 + n_2 S_2 + \dots n_M S_M \to \dots$ with
stoichiometric substrate coefficients $\{n_i\}_{i=1}^M$ and rate constant $k$,
the corresponding ODE and SDE rate laws are taken to be
```math
k \prod_{i=1}^M \frac{(S_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!},
```
while the jump process transition rate (i.e., the propensity or intensity
function) is
```math
k \prod_{i=1}^M \frac{S_i (S_i-1) \dots (S_i-n_i+1)}{n_i!}.
```
For example, the rate law of the reaction $2X + 3Y \to Z$ with rate constant $k$ would be
```math
k \frac{X^2}{2!} \frac{Y^3}{3!} \\
```
giving the ODE model
```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{dX}{dt} &=  -2 k \frac{X^2}{2!} \frac{Y^3}{3!}, &
\frac{dY}{dt} &=  -3 k \frac{X^2}{2!} \frac{Y^3}{3!}, &
\frac{dZ}{dt} &= k \frac{X^2}{2!} \frac{Y^3}{3!}.
\end{align*}
```
This implicit rescaling of rate constants can be disabled through explicit
conversion of a [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) to another system via
[`Base.convert`](@ref) using the `combinatoric_ratelaws=false` keyword
argument, i.e.
```julia
rn = @reaction_network ...
convert(ODESystem, rn; combinatoric_ratelaws=false)
```

For the previous example using this keyword argument would give the rate law
```math
k X^2 Y^3
```
and the ODE model
```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{dX}{dt} &=  -2 k X^2 Y^3, &
\frac{dY}{dt} &=  -3 k X^2 Y^3, &
\frac{dZ}{dt} &= k X^2 Y^3.
\end{align*}
```

## Notes
1. For each of the preceding models we converted the `ReactionSystem` to, i.e.,
   ODEs, jumps, or SDEs, we had two paths for conversion:

    a. Convert to the corresponding ModelingToolkit system and then use it in
       creating the corresponding problem.

    b. Directly create the desired problem type from the `ReactionSystem`.

   The latter is more convenient, however, the former will be more efficient if
   one needs to repeatedly create the associated `Problem`.
2. ModelingToolkit offers many options for optimizing the generated ODEs and
   SDEs, including options to build functions for evaluating Jacobians and/or
   multithreaded versions of derivative evaluation functions. See the options
   for
   [`ODEProblem`s](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/systems/ODESystem/#DiffEqBase.ODEProblem)
   and
   [`SDEProblem`s](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/systems/SDESystem/#DiffEqBase.SDEProblem).
